# LoRa Gateway Bridge documentation

LoRa Gateway Bridge is a service which abstracts the 
[packet_forwarder UDP protocol](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder/blob/master/PROTOCOL.TXT)
running on most LoRa gateways into JSON over MQTT. It enables you to use MQTT for
receiving data from and sending data to your gateways.

## Project components

This project exists out of multiple components

![architecture](https://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/image/11010339/L.png)

* [lora-gateway-bridge](https://github.com/brocaar/lora-gateway-bridge) - converts
  the [packet_forwarder protocol](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder/blob/master/PROTOCOL.TXT)
  to MQTT and back
* [loraserver](https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver) - LoRaWAN network-server
* [lora-app-server](https://github.com/brocaar/lora-app-server) - LoRaWAN
  application-server
* lora-controller (todo) - LoRaWAN network-controller

## Compatibility

The table below shows the compatibility between LoRa Gateway Bridge and the
packet_forwarder UDP protocol versions:

| LoRa Gateway Bridge | packet_forwarder protocol version | Note                                                                |

| 2.0.x               | 2                                 | This protocol is used since version 3.0.0 of the `packet_forwarder` |
| >= 2.1.x            | 1 & 2 simultaneously              | Both protocol versions are supported and auto-detected              |
