# LoRa Gateway Bridge documentation

LoRa Gateway Bridge is a service which abstracts the 
[packet_forwarder UDP protocol](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder/blob/master/PROTOCOL.TXT)
running on most LoRa gateways into JSON over MQTT. It enables you to use MQTT for
receiving data from and sending data to your gateways.
This project is part of [LoRa Server](http://docs.loraserver.io/loraserver/).

## Compatibility

The table below shows the compatibility between LoRa Gateway Bridge and the
packet_forwarder UDP protocol versions:

| LoRa Gateway Bridge | packet_forwarder protocol version | Note                                                                |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.x.x               | 1                                 |                                                                     |
| 2.x.x               | 2                                 | This protocol is used since version 3.0.0 of the `packet_forwarder` |


LoRa Gateway Bridge v1.x.x will be update with bugfixes for the near future as
not all gateways are using packet_forwarder v3.0.0+ yet.
